# Source Integration Guide

OTEX's solver network infrastructure runs off-chain. For new liquidity sources, this means that in order to receive order flow from the solver network, 
our off-chain solving systems must be able to generate indicative quotes at different trade volumes for the pending block.

Internally, quotes are generated by means of quoting logic written in Python. The quoting logic is an off-chain implementation of the 
quoting logic found on different types of liquidity pools on-chain. Folder "sample_integration" provides an example of how OTEX generates indicative 
quotes for Uniswap v2 pools.


# Integration Requirements

1. Fill-in the quoting dependencies following the sample integration from Uniswap V2:

    1.1 Fill-in the pool helper

    1.2 Fill-in pool model

2. Test quoting dependencies. 

    2.1 Generate test instances. A test instance consists of block number, swap parameters, liquidity states at testing block, expected test result.

    2.2 Validate quoting logic for each pool type.
